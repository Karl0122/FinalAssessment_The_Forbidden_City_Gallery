intro: The Hall of Harmony is 19 metres high and the building is square in overall form, with a single gable roof with four corners saved and covered with yellow glazed tiles and a copper gilt-painted throne roof in the centre. It is the smallest of the first three halls. On the pedestal where the three halls are located, there are drainage openings in the shape of a dragon's head. When it rains, the drainage heads spray water together, creating a landscape of 'a thousand dragons spitting water'. The Hall of Central Harmony was known as the Hall of Huagai in the early Ming dynasty. 
intro2: It was rebuilt after a fire during the Jiajing period and was renamed the Hall of Zhongji, with the Ming Dynasty the Hall of Zhongji ink still remaining on the ceiling. In the first year of the Qing dynasty (1644), the Qing imperial family moved into the Forbidden City, and the following year the Zhongji Hall was renamed the Hall of Central Harmony. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, before the various ceremonies held in The Hall of Supreme Harmony, the emperor first took a break in The Hall of Central Harmony and received a pilgrimage from the deacon's officials.
