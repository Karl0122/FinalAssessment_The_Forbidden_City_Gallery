intro: Palace of Heavenly Purit has a yellow glazed tile with a heavy eaves hipped roof, situated on a single-storey Chinese white stone pedestal, with a wide 9-room gallery and a depth of 5 rooms, more than 20 metres high from the platform to the main ridge. The hall is connected by a bright room and a secondary room to the east and west. The back eaves are set between two golden pillars with a screen and a throne in front of the screen, with a plaque hanging above the throne. The two east and west rooms are warming pavilions, and the front eaves have a fairy tower. In front of the hall, there are bronze tortoises, bronze cranes, sundials and gilded incense burners.
intro2: The Palace of Heavenly Purit was the largest building in the inner court and served as the bedchamber for 14 emperors of the Ming Dynasty. It was also used as a place of mourning for the emperors in the Ming Dynasty. In the Qing dynasty, before the Kangxi period, the Ming system was followed, and since the Yongzheng emperor moved to the Yangxin Hall, it was used as an important place for the emperor to summon courtiers, to read and write chapters on daily affairs, to receive foreign vassals, to be congratulated and to hold banquets at the specific time of the year. Some of the daily offices, including the study room for the Emperor's son, were also moved into other rooms around the Palace of Heavenly Purit.
