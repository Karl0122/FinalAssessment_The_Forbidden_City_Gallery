intro: the Hall of Preserving Harmony’s most striking visual feature is a massive marble carving resting behind the hall. The ramp is carved with cloud dragon designs. The enormous stone carving sits in the center of the stairway leading down from the hall. It was originally sculpted in the Ming Dynasty, and not touched again until the Qing Dynasty when it was re-sculpted. Sixteen and a half meters long, three meters wide, and 1.7 meters high, the cloud dragon carving weighed in at over 200 tons. The carving pictures 9 dragons amongst floating clouds, symbolizing the unity of the Chinese empire and the power divinely granted to the emperor by the heavens.The Hall of Preserving Harmony was known as the Hall of Honour at the beginning of the Ming dynasty, before being renamed the Hall of Jianji in the 41st year of the Ming dynasty (1562) and The Hall of Preserving Harmony in the 2nd year of the Qing dynasty (1645). 
intro2: The Hall of Preserving Harmony was used differently in the Ming and Qing dynasties, where the emperor used to change his clothes before the Ming dynasty ceremonies, and when the empress and the crown prince was crowned, the emperor was congratulated in this hall. In the Qing dynasty, every year on New Year's Eve and the 15th day of the first month, the emperor gave a feast to foreign clans, princes and ministers of one or two grades, which were very spectacular scenes. In addition, the family feast and each of the Imperial examinations are held in The Hall of Preserving Harmony.
