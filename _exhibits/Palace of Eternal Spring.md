Inside, there is a floor screen with a throne. There is a curtain tent to the left and right to separate the second room, and the room to the north is the bedchamber. A pair of bronze tortoises and cranes are set up in front of the hall.The name of Eternal Spring Palace means eternal youth symbolized by spring. It used to be residences of imperial concubines. After Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty ascended the throne, the palace was rebuilt in 1683 and later renovated many times. The biggest renovation was in 1859, when the inner gate of the palace was dismantled so as to connect with the neighbouring Hall of the Supreme Principle.

The mural paintings are exquisite and elegant, showing the exquisite craftsmanship and profound skills of painters in the late Qing Dynasty.The palace also has a veranda near Tiyuan hall converted into an traditional opera stage, where Peking opera performances were performed for Empress Dowager Cixi.
