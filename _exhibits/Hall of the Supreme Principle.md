intro: Hall of the Supreme principle has five rooms, two side halls and rear hall. The Qixiang gate are equipped with wooden screen believed to protect the house from mischievous spirits. The main hall has gabled roof covered with yellow glazed tiles like most palaces in Forbidden City . The beams are decorated with Suzhou-style paintings, golden dragons and phoenixes. The walls are intricately decorated with medallions of phoenixes sitting on the mountain, untypically for other palaces. The Hall of the Supreme Principle originally named "Palace of Endless Good Omens" by Jiajing Emperor in 1535. The palace was renamed as "Hall of Supreme Principle" in 1741. In the late Qing dynasty, it was renovated and united with the Palace of Eternal Spring as a large compound.
intro2: Hall of the Supreme Principle is one of the chambers. During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Zhu Yijun temporarily stayed at the Hall of the Supreme Principle when two palaces in the Imperial Palace were hit by fire. During the Qing Dynasty, a play was performed here for half a month to celebrate the 50th birthday of Empress Dowager Cixi.
