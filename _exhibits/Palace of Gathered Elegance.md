The entire courtyard is decorated in stately antiquity. The interior of the palace is exquisitely decorated. Behind the main room is a carved glass screen of heather. The platform is decorated with a mirror-hearted screen of carved rosewood inlaid with the word longevity, with a throne, a few incense sticks, a palace fan and an incense cone in front of the screen.

Walls of the roofed corridors in the courtyard are inscribed with a Long Life Odes by the courtiers for her fiftieth birthday. In addition, Wan Rong, the last empress of the Qing Dynasty in China, also lived in this palace.
