intro: A pair of bronze dragons and a pair of bronze deer are set up under the outer platform of the Palace of Gathered Elegance, the only exception to the presence of dragons in the six palaces of the Forbidden City. The entire courtyard is decorated in stately antiquity. The interior of the palace is exquisitely decorated. Behind the main room is a carved glass screen of heather. The platform is decorated with a mirror-hearted screen of carved rosewood inlaid with the word longevity, with a throne, a few incense sticks, a palace fan and an incense cone in front of the screen.
intro2: The Palace of Gathered Elegance also used to be residences of imperial concubines. Notable among the consorts who lived here was the Empress Dowager Cixi. She lived here when she was young as Consort Yi. In the rear hall, she gave birth to Zaichun, the only son of the Xianfeng Emperor and became the Tongzhi Emperor. Walls of the roofed corridors in the courtyard are inscribed with a Long Life Odes by the courtiers for her fiftieth birthday. In addition, Wan Rong, the last empress of the Qing Dynasty in China, also lived in this palace.
