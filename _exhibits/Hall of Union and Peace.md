intro: The Hall of Union and Peace is square in plan, with a wide face and a depth of 3 rooms each, with a gilt roof of yellow glazed tiles with four corners, smaller than the Hall of Harmony. There is a throne in the hall, behind the throne there are 4 screens, on the Qianlong imperial pen "Jiaotai Hall inscription". The roof of the hall is centred on eight algal wells. The single eave, four-cornered, gilded copper roof, yellow glazed tiles, double-angled five-step arch, beam and square decorated with dragon and phoenix and seal colour painting. The doors are open on all four sides, with three crosses and six diamond flowers, and four doors each with a dragon and phoenix skirt, with a sill window on the southern side and walls on the remaining three sides. The hall is topped by a pavilion with a dragon and beads, and the floor is plastered with gold tiles. A throne is set up in the bright room of the hall, on which is suspended the Kangxi Emperor's imperial letter 'Wu Wei' plaque, and behind the throne there is a panel screen, on which is written the Qianlong Emperor's imperial inscription 'Jiaotai Hall'. A copper pot dripping from the east is set up in the second room, and is no longer used after the Qianlong years.
intro2: On the west side of the hall, there is a self-timed bell, which was made in the third year of the Jiaqing era. The time in the palace is based on this. The self-timer is about 6 metres high and is the largest surviving ancient bell in China. The throne is now lined up on either side of the palace to store the emperor's precious seal. Above the throne is a plaque inscribed with the imperial handwriting of the Kangxi Emperor, and behind the throne is a panel with the imperial inscription of the Qianlong Emperor's 'Jiaotai Hall'. In the east of the hall, there is a copper pot dripping, which was no longer used after the Qianlong years. A large self-timed bell is set in the west chamber, and the time in the palace is based on this.
