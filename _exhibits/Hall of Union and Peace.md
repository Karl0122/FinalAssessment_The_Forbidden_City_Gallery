intro: The Hall of Union is square in plan, with a wide face and a depth of 3 rooms each, with a gilt roof of yellow glazed tiles with four corners, smaller than the Hall of Harmony. There is a throne in the hall, behind the throne there are 4 screens, on the Qianlong imperial pen "Jiaotai Hall inscription". The roof of the hall is centred on eight algal wells. The single eave, four-cornered, gilded copper roof, yellow glazed tiles, double-angled five-step arch, beam and square decorated with dragon and phoenix and seal colour painting. The doors are open on all four sides, with three crosses and six diamond flowers, and four doors each with a dragon and phoenix skirt, with a sill window on the southern side and walls on the remaining three sides. The hall is topped by a pavilion with a dragon and beads, and the floor is plastered with gold tiles. 
intro2: On New Year's Day and the Empress's birthday, the Empress received her congratulations here. In the thirteenth year of the Qianlong reign (1748), the Qianlong emperor stored the twenty-five seals, a symbol of imperial power, here, and thus became a place for the storage of seals. The throne is now lined up on either side of the hall to store the emperor's seals. In the east of the hall, there is a copper pot dripping, which was no longer used after the Qianlong years. A large self-timed bell is set in the west chamber, and the time in the palace is based on this.
